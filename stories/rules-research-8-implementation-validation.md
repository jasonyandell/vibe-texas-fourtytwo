## Validation Results

### Sources Consulted and Cross-Referenced

**Primary Authoritative Sources:**
1. **Pagat.com Texas 42 Rules** - https://www.pagat.com/domino/trick/42.html
   - Comprehensive, well-documented
   - Covers both marks and points versions
   - Includes variations and special contracts

2. **Wikipedia List of Domino Games** - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_domino_games
   - Basic overview and confirmation
   - Validates core mechanics
   - Confirms equipment requirements

3. **Existing Documentation** - docs/rules/ directory
   - Core mechanics summary
   - Bidding summary
   - Scoring summary
   - Gameplay flow summary

### Rule Consistency Validation

**✅ CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL SOURCES:**

**Equipment and Setup:**
- Double-6 domino set (28 dominoes)
- 4 players in partnerships
- 7 dominoes per player
- Clockwise dealing and play

**Point Values:**
- 6-4 = 10 points
- 5-5 = 10 points
- 5-0 = 5 points
- 4-1 = 5 points
- 3-2 = 5 points
- Each trick = 1 point
- Total = 42 points

**Basic Bidding:**
- Minimum bid: 30
- Bid increments: Any amount
- Bidding sequence: Clockwise from dealer's left
- Each player bids once

**Trump Suits:**
- 7 possible trump suits (0-6)
- Doubles can be trump
- Trump hierarchy: Double highest, then by other number

**Trick-Taking:**
- Must follow suit if possible
- Trump beats non-trump
- Winner leads next trick

### Conflicts Resolved

**❓ MINOR VARIATIONS DOCUMENTED:**

**Forced Bidding:**
- **Standard:** All pass = throw in hand
- **Variation:** Dealer must bid if all others pass
- **Resolution:** Document both, recommend variation as house rule

**Opening Lead:**
- **Standard:** Declarer can lead any domino
- **Variation:** Small end opening (specify which end counts)
- **Resolution:** Standard rule for implementation, variation as option

**Special Contracts:**
- **Core:** Nello, Plunge, Sevens
- **Variations:** Splash, different Nello options
- **Resolution:** Implement core contracts, variations as extensions
