# Texas 42 Rules Research Story

## Overview
As a developer implementing the Texas 42 web game, I need to thoroughly research and document the authentic rules, scoring system, and gameplay mechanics of Texas 42 to ensure our implementation is accurate and true to the traditional game.

## User Story
**As a** Texas 42 player  
**I want** the web game to follow authentic Texas 42 rules  
**So that** I can play the game exactly as I would in person with physical dominoes

## Research Objectives

### 1. Core Game Mechanics
- [ ] Document the complete set of double-6 dominoes (28 pieces)
- [ ] Understand partnership arrangement (4 players, partners across from each other)
- [ ] Research bidding phase rules and mechanics
- [ ] Document trick-taking gameplay and follow-suit rules
- [ ] Understand trump suit mechanics and how they work

### 2. Bidding System
- [ ] Minimum bid requirements
- [ ] Bidding sequence and turn order
- [ ] Special bids (if any)
- [ ] What happens when all players pass
- [ ] Bid increments and maximum bids

### 3. Scoring System
- [ ] Point values for specific dominoes
- [ ] How tricks are scored
- [ ] Partnership scoring mechanics
- [ ] Game-ending conditions
- [ ] Bonus points or special scoring rules

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- [ ] Who leads the first trick
- [ ] Follow-suit requirements
- [ ] When players can play trump
- [ ] Trick-winning determination
- [ ] Turn order for subsequent tricks

### 5. Special Rules and Edge Cases
- [ ] What happens with invalid plays
- [ ] Handling of misdeal situations
- [ ] Rules for exposed dominoes
- [ ] End-of-hand procedures
- [ ] Tie-breaking mechanisms

## Research Sources

### Primary Sources
- [ ] Official Texas 42 rulebooks
- [ ] Domino game authorities and organizations
- [ ] Traditional Texas 42 player communities

### Secondary Sources
- [ ] Online Texas 42 implementations for comparison
- [ ] Game rule websites and databases
- [ ] Academic papers on domino games

### Validation Sources
- [ ] Multiple independent rule sources
- [ ] Cross-reference with existing digital implementations
- [ ] Consultation with experienced Texas 42 players

## Deliverables

## Research Questions to Answer

### Critical Questions
1. What is the exact minimum bid in Texas 42?
2. How are trump suits determined and used?
3. Which dominoes have point values and what are they?
4. What constitutes a valid play in each situation?
5. How is the winner of each trick determined?

### Implementation Questions
1. How should invalid moves be handled?
2. What information should be visible to each player?
3. How should the game handle disconnections or timeouts?
4. What are the exact rules for following suit?
5. How should ties be broken in bidding or scoring?

### Edge Case Questions
1. What happens if a player cannot follow suit?
2. How are misdeals handled?
3. What if two dominoes are played simultaneously?
4. How are scoring disputes resolved?
5. What happens in case of a tie game?

## Validation Criteria

### Accuracy Requirements
- [ ] Rules match at least 3 independent authoritative sources
- [ ] Scoring system verified with worked examples
- [ ] Edge cases documented with official resolutions
- [ ] No contradictions between different rule aspects

### Completeness Requirements
- [ ] All possible game situations covered
- [ ] Clear procedures for every game phase
- [ ] Unambiguous language for all rules
- [ ] Examples provided for complex situations

## Implementation Readiness Checklist

### For Backend Development
- [ ] Complete rule engine specification
- [ ] All scoring calculations defined
- [ ] Edge case handling procedures
- [ ] Game state validation rules

### For Frontend Development
- [ ] Visual requirements for dominoes
- [ ] UI flow for bidding phase
- [ ] Player interaction patterns
- [ ] Information display requirements

### For Testing
- [ ] Test scenarios for all rules
- [ ] Edge case test cases
- [ ] Scoring validation examples
- [ ] Invalid move test cases

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete, unambiguous rule documentation
- [ ] All research questions answered
- [ ] Rules validated against multiple sources
- [ ] Implementation-ready specifications
- [ ] Test cases defined for all rules
- [ ] Visual and UI requirements documented

## Timeline
- **Research Phase**: 2-3 days for comprehensive rule gathering
- **Validation Phase**: 1 day for cross-referencing sources
- **Documentation Phase**: 1 day for creating implementation-ready docs
- **Review Phase**: 1 day for technical review and clarification

## Dependencies
- Access to authoritative Texas 42 rule sources
- Ability to validate rules with experienced players
- Technical review by development team

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Conflicting rules between sources
  - **Mitigation**: Document variations and choose most authoritative source
- **Risk**: Incomplete rule coverage
  - **Mitigation**: Systematic review against multiple complete sources
- **Risk**: Implementation complexity not considered
  - **Mitigation**: Include technical feasibility review in research
