# Story: Texas 42 Trick-Taking Mechanics Research

## Overview
Research and document the detailed trick-taking mechanics for Texas 42, including play order, following suit, and trick-winning determination.

## User Story
**As a** developer implementing Texas 42 gameplay  
**I want** to understand all trick-taking rules and mechanics  
**So that** I can implement correct domino play validation and trick resolution

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Document who leads the first trick and subsequent tricks
- [x] Define follow-suit requirements and exceptions
- [x] Specify trick-winning determination logic
- [x] Document valid play rules for each situation
- [x] Identify edge cases and special situations

## Research Tasks
- [x] Research who leads the first trick (winning bidder)
- [x] Document follow-suit rules (must follow if possible)
- [x] Research what constitutes "following suit" with dominoes
- [x] Determine when players can play trump
- [x] Research trick-winning hierarchy (trump beats non-trump, etc.)
- [x] Document turn order for subsequent tricks
- [x] Research any special play rules or restrictions

## Research Findings

### Trick Leadership Rules

**First Trick:**
- **High bidder (declarer) leads** to the first trick
- Can lead any domino from their hand
- **Small end opening variation:** Some allow declarer to specify which end of a non-trump domino counts as the suit

**Subsequent Tricks:**
- **Winner of previous trick leads** to next trick
- Play continues clockwise around table

### Follow-Suit Requirements

**Basic Rule:** Players **must follow suit if possible**

**What Constitutes Following Suit:**
1. **Trump led:** Must play trump if you have any trump
2. **Non-trump led:** Must play domino of the same suit if possible
3. **No suit dominoes:** Can play any domino (including trump)

**Important Domino Suit Rules:**
- **Non-trump dominoes belong to BOTH number suits** they contain
- **Example:** 6-5 can follow either sixes OR fives (when neither is trump)
- **Trump dominoes:** Only belong to trump suit, not their number suits

### Suit Determination for Led Dominoes

**When Non-Trump Domino is Led:**
- **Counts as the HIGHER numbered suit**
- **Example:** 6-5 led counts as a six (not a five)
- **Exception:** If one end is trump, the non-trump end determines suit

**When Trump Domino is Led:**
- **Always counts as trump suit**
- **All players must follow with trump if possible**

### Trick-Winning Hierarchy

**Priority Order (highest to lowest):**
1. **Highest trump** in the trick
2. **Highest domino of suit led** (if no trump played)
3. **Other dominoes** have no chance to win

**Within Trump Suit:**
- **Double trump** beats all other trumps
- **Other trumps** rank by the other number (highest to lowest)

**Within Non-Trump Suits:**
- **Double** is highest of its suit
- **Other dominoes** rank by the other number (highest to lowest)

### Valid Play Determination

**Algorithm for Valid Plays:**
```
1. Determine suit led (higher number of led domino, or trump)
2. Check if player has dominoes of that suit:
   - If YES: Must play from that suit
   - If NO: Can play any domino
3. For trump suit:
   - If trump led: Must play trump if available
   - If non-trump led: Can trump only if no suit dominoes available
```

### Special Play Rules

**Opening Lead Variations:**
- **Standard:** Declarer can lead any domino
- **Small End Opening:** Declarer can specify which end of non-trump domino counts
- **Trump Must Lead:** Some variations require trump opening lead

**Doubles as Trump Special Rules:**
- **Can only trump** if you have no dominoes of suit led
- **Cannot trump** if you have any domino of the suit led (even if you also have doubles)

## Implementation Specifications

### Play Validation Algorithm
```javascript
function getValidPlays(playerHand, trick, trumpSuit) {
  if (trick.length === 0) {
    // Leading: can play any domino
    return playerHand;
  }

  const suitLed = getSuitLed(trick[0], trumpSuit);
  const suitDominoes = playerHand.filter(domino =>
    belongsToSuit(domino, suitLed, trumpSuit)
  );

  if (suitDominoes.length > 0) {
    // Must follow suit
    return suitDominoes;
  }

  // Cannot follow suit: can play anything
  return playerHand;
}

function belongsToSuit(domino, suit, trumpSuit) {
  if (suit === 'trump') {
    return isTrump(domino, trumpSuit);
  }

  // Non-trump suit: domino belongs if it contains that number
  // and is not a trump
  return (domino.high === suit || domino.low === suit) &&
         !isTrump(domino, trumpSuit);
}

function getSuitLed(leadDomino, trumpSuit) {
  if (isTrump(leadDomino, trumpSuit)) {
    return 'trump';
  }

  // Non-trump: higher number determines suit
  return Math.max(leadDomino.high, leadDomino.low);
}
```

### Trick Winner Calculation
```javascript
function getTrickWinner(trick, trumpSuit, leader) {
  const suitLed = getSuitLed(trick[0], trumpSuit);
  let winningPlay = { domino: trick[0], player: leader, index: 0 };

  for (let i = 1; i < trick.length; i++) {
    const currentDomino = trick[i];
    const currentPlayer = getPlayerByIndex(leader, i);

    if (beats(currentDomino, winningPlay.domino, trumpSuit, suitLed)) {
      winningPlay = { domino: currentDomino, player: currentPlayer, index: i };
    }
  }

  return winningPlay.player;
}

function beats(domino1, domino2, trumpSuit, suitLed) {
  const trump1 = isTrump(domino1, trumpSuit);
  const trump2 = isTrump(domino2, trumpSuit);

  // Trump beats non-trump
  if (trump1 && !trump2) return true;
  if (trump2 && !trump1) return false;

  // Both trump: compare trump ranks
  if (trump1 && trump2) {
    return getTrumpRank(domino1, trumpSuit) > getTrumpRank(domino2, trumpSuit);
  }

  // Both non-trump: must be same suit to beat
  const suit1 = getDominoSuit(domino1, trumpSuit);
  const suit2 = getDominoSuit(domino2, trumpSuit);

  if (suit1 !== suitLed) return false; // Can't beat if not following suit
  if (suit2 !== suitLed) return true;  // Beats if opponent not following suit

  // Same suit: compare ranks
  return getDominoRank(domino1) > getDominoRank(domino2);
}
```

### Turn Order Management
```javascript
class TrickManager {
  constructor(leader) {
    this.leader = leader;
    this.currentPlayer = leader;
    this.trick = [];
    this.tricksWon = [];
  }

  playDomino(domino, player) {
    if (player !== this.currentPlayer) {
      throw new Error('Not your turn');
    }

    const validPlays = getValidPlays(player.hand, this.trick, this.trumpSuit);
    if (!validPlays.includes(domino)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid play');
    }

    this.trick.push(domino);
    this.currentPlayer = getNextPlayer(this.currentPlayer);

    if (this.trick.length === 4) {
      this.completeTrick();
    }
  }

  completeTrick() {
    const winner = getTrickWinner(this.trick, this.trumpSuit, this.leader);
    this.tricksWon.push({ trick: this.trick, winner: winner });
    this.leader = winner;
    this.currentPlayer = winner;
    this.trick = [];
  }
}
```

### UI Requirements
- **Valid play highlighting:** Show which dominoes can be legally played
- **Suit indicators:** Visual indication of suit led and trump suit
- **Trick display:** Show current trick in progress
- **Turn indicator:** Clear indication of whose turn it is
- **Trick history:** Access to previously won tricks
- **Play validation feedback:** Clear error messages for invalid plays

2. **Core Mechanics Summary** - docs/rules/core-mechanics-summary.md

## Story Status: COMPLETE âœ…
All acceptance criteria met. Trick-taking mechanics are implementation-ready with complete validation and winner determination algorithms.

## Estimated Effort
4-5 hours

## Dependencies
- Trump Suit System research (for trump vs non-trump logic)
- Equipment and Setup research (for turn order)

## Notes
Trick-taking is the core gameplay mechanic. Understanding exactly when a domino can be played and how tricks are won is essential for a functional game implementation.
