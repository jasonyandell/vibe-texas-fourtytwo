# Demo Plan Phase 8: Integration & Performance

## Prerequisites
**CRITICAL**: Read and understand all documentation in @docs/ before starting:
- `@docs/design.md` - TDD methodology and performance requirements
- `@docs/DEVELOPER.md` - Development standards and optimization practices
- `@stories/demo-plan-0.md` - Overview of demo showcase requirements
- Review all previous phases to ensure integration points

**Dependency**: Phase 7 (Polish & Accessibility) must be complete with all tests passing.

## Goal
Integrate all demo sections into a cohesive experience with optimized performance, smooth animations, and comprehensive cross-browser testing.

## What to Build
- Seamless navigation between all sections with state preservation
- Performance optimizations for smooth interactions with all game objects
- Cross-section integration features (e.g., trump highlighting affects domino section)
- Loading states and error handling throughout
- Comprehensive end-to-end testing across all browsers

## Key Features
- **Seamless Navigation**: Smooth transitions between sections with state preservation
- **Cross-Section Integration**: Actions in one section affect displays in others
- **Performance Optimization**: Fast loading and smooth animations throughout
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and skeleton screens
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states with recovery options
- **Browser Compatibility**: Consistent experience across Chrome, Firefox, Safari

## Success Criteria
- Navigation between sections is smooth and maintains state
- Cross-section integrations work correctly (trump selection highlights dominoes)
- Performance is excellent on both desktop and mobile devices
- Loading states provide good user feedback
- Error handling is graceful and informative
- All browsers provide consistent experience
- Complete test suite passes across all environments

## TDD Approach
1. Write failing tests for cross-section integration and performance
2. Implement state management and cross-section communication
3. Add performance optimizations and loading states
4. Conduct comprehensive cross-browser testing

## Key Components to Create
- `DemoStateProvider` - Global state management for cross-section features
- Performance optimization utilities (memoization, lazy loading)
- Loading and error state components
- Cross-browser compatibility enhancements
- Comprehensive integration test suite

## Testing Focus
- Cross-section integration functionality
- Performance benchmarks and optimization
- Loading state behavior
- Error handling and recovery
- Cross-browser compatibility
- End-to-end user workflows
- Mobile device performance

This final phase ensures the demo provides a polished, professional experience that showcases the Texas 42 game implementation effectively across all platforms and browsers.
