## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Bidding Logic
```typescript
// Bid validation with special contracts
export function isValidBid(bid: Bid, currentHighBid?: Bid, playerHand?: Domino[]): boolean {
  // Point bid validation
  if (!bid.isSpecialContract) {
    if (bid.amount < 30 || bid.amount > 41) return false;
    if (currentHighBid && bid.amount <= currentHighBid.amount) return false;
    return true;
  }
  
  // Special contract validation
  return validateSpecialContract(bid, playerHand);
}

// Special contract validation
export function validateSpecialContract(bid: Bid, playerHand: Domino[]): boolean {
  switch (bid.contractType) {
    case 'plunge':
      // Must have 4+ doubles
      const doubles = playerHand.filter(d => d.high === d.low);
      return doubles.length >= 4;
    case 'nello':
      // Any player can bid Nello
      return true;
    case 'sevens':
      // Any player can bid Sevens
      return true;
    case 'follow-me':
      // Any player can bid Follow Me
      return true;
    default:
      return false;
  }
}

// Mark conversion
export function convertBidToPoints(bid: Bid): number {
  if (bid.marks) {
    return bid.marks * 42; // 1 mark = 42 points
  }
  return bid.amount;
}
```

### UI Components

- **BidButton**: Individual bid option buttons
- **SpecialContractSelector**: Interface for special contract selection
- **TrumpSelector**: Trump suit selection after winning bid
- **BidHistory**: Display of all bids made
- **BidValidation**: Real-time validation feedback

## Game Logic Integration

### Bidding Flow

2. **Turn-Based Bidding**: Clockwise from dealer's left
3. **Bid Validation**: Real-time validation with rules compliance
4. **Special Contract Handling**: Additional validation and UI
5. **Trump Selection**: Winner chooses trump suit
