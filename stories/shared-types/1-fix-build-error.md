# Fix Build Error - Export Conflict Resolution

## Goal
Fix the immediate build error caused by `isValidGameState` export conflict and restore working build pipeline.

## Problem
Frontend build fails because `isValidGameState` is not properly exported from shared-types package. There are two validation functions with similar names causing confusion:
- `isValidGameState` from `type-guards.ts` (for unified GameState)
- `isValidLegacyGameState` from `frontend-compat.ts` (for legacy compatibility)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Frontend build completes successfully
- [ ] All tests pass (449/449)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No linting warnings

## TDD Approach
1. **Red**: Verify build failure with specific error message
2. **Green**: Fix export issue and ensure build passes
3. **Refactor**: Clean up any remaining export inconsistencies

## Files to Read for Context
- `packages/shared-types/src/index.ts` - Main exports file
- `packages/shared-types/src/type-guards.ts` - Main validation functions
- `packages/shared-types/src/frontend-compat.ts` - Legacy compatibility layer
- `frontend/src/contexts/GameStateContext.tsx` - Import usage
- `packages/shared-types/dist/index.d.ts` - Generated type definitions

## Implementation Steps
1. Verify current export structure in shared-types index.ts
2. Ensure `isValidGameState` from type-guards.ts is properly exported
3. Rebuild shared-types package
4. Test frontend build
5. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions

## Acceptance Test
```bash
npm run build
npm test
```

## Estimated Time
5 minutes
