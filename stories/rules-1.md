# Story: Texas 42 Rules Research - Part 1: Resource Gathering & Core Mechanics

## Overview
As a developer implementing the Texas 42 web game, I need to thoroughly research and document the authentic rules, scoring system, and gameplay mechanics of Texas 42 to ensure our implementation is accurate and true to the traditional game. This first part focuses on gathering resources and understanding the core game mechanics.

## User Story
**As a** Texas 42 player
**I want** the web game to follow authentic Texas 42 rules
**So that** I can play the game exactly as I would in person with physical dominoes

## Research Objectives - Part 1

### 1. Core Game Mechanics
- [ ] Document the complete set of double-6 dominoes (28 pieces)
- [ ] Understand partnership arrangement (4 players, partners across from each other)
- [ ] Research bidding phase rules and mechanics (high-level overview)
- [ ] Document trick-taking gameplay and follow-suit rules (high-level overview)
- [ ] Understand trump suit mechanics and how they work (high-level overview)

## Resource Gathering Story
**As a** developer,
**I need to** identify and collect authoritative sources for Texas 42 rules,
**So that** I can ensure the accuracy and authenticity of our game implementation.

### Research Sources
#### Primary Sources
- [ ] Official Texas 42 rulebooks
- [ ] Domino game authorities and organizations
- [ ] Traditional Texas 42 player communities

#### Secondary Sources
- [ ] Online Texas 42 implementations for comparison
- [ ] Game rule websites and databases
- [ ] Academic papers on domino games

#### Validation Sources
- [ ] Multiple independent rule sources
- [ ] Cross-reference with existing digital implementations
- [ ] Consultation with experienced Texas 42 players

## Deliverables - Part 1

### 1. Initial Rules Document (Core Mechanics)
```markdown
# Texas 42 Official Rules - Core Mechanics

## Equipment
- Double-6 domino set (28 dominoes)
- 4 players arranged in partnerships

## Setup
[Detailed setup procedures - to be refined in later stories]

## Core Gameplay Overview
[High-level description of bidding, trick-taking, and trump]
```

### 2. Domino Reference
- [ ] Complete list of all 28 dominoes
- [ ] Point values for each domino (initial research)
- [ ] Special dominoes and their significance (initial research)
- [ ] Visual representation requirements

## Research Questions to Answer - Part 1

### Critical Questions
1. What is the exact minimum bid in Texas 42? (Initial understanding)
2. How are trump suits determined and used? (Initial understanding)
3. Which dominoes have point values and what are they?
4. What constitutes a valid play in each situation? (Initial understanding)
5. How is the winner of each trick determined? (Initial understanding)

## Validation Criteria - Part 1

### Accuracy Requirements
- [ ] Rules match at least 3 independent authoritative sources for core mechanics
- [ ] No contradictions between different rule aspects for core mechanics

### Completeness Requirements
- [ ] All core game situations covered
- [ ] Unambiguous language for core rules

## Implementation Readiness Checklist - Part 1

### For Backend Development
- [ ] Basic rule engine specification for core mechanics
- [ ] Initial scoring calculations defined for domino values

### For Frontend Development
- [ ] Visual requirements for dominoes
- [ ] Initial UI flow for game setup

## Success Criteria - Part 1
- [ ] Initial, unambiguous rule documentation for core mechanics
- [ ] All research questions for core mechanics answered
- [ ] Rules validated against multiple sources for core mechanics
- [ ] Initial implementation-ready specifications for core mechanics
- [ ] Visual and UI requirements for dominoes documented

## Timeline
- **Research Phase (Core Mechanics & Resource Gathering)**: 1-2 days
- **Documentation Phase (Core Mechanics)**: 0.5 day
- **Review Phase**: 0.5 day

## Dependencies
- Access to authoritative Texas 42 rule sources
- Ability to validate rules with experienced players

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Conflicting rules between sources
  - **Mitigation**: Document variations and choose most authoritative source
- **Risk**: Incomplete rule coverage
  - **Mitigation**: Systematic review against multiple complete sources
