# Kid Review (by a 5-year-old) ðŸ§¸

## What's Too Hard to Understand

- What's a "lobby"? Is it like a waiting room? I don't know what that means!
- "Filter by status" - I don't know what filter means. Is it like a coffee filter?
- "Sort by" - Why do I need to sort things? I just want to play!
- "Waiting for Players", "In Progress", "Completed" - Too many big words!
- "Texas 42" - Is this about Texas? I thought we were playing with dominoes!
- "players online" - What does online mean? Are they on a line?

## What's Boring or Not Fun

- Too much reading! There's SO MANY WORDS everywhere!
- No pictures of dominoes or anything fun
- The buttons are just words - no fun pictures
- Everything is gray and boring looking
- No colors! Where are the rainbow colors?
- That weird drawing in the empty box doesn't look like dominoes at all

## What Would Make It More Kid-Friendly

- BIG buttons with pictures!
  - A button with dominoes that says "Play!" 
  - A button with friends holding hands that says "Play with Friends!"
  
- Use fun colors!
  - Make the "Create Game" button green like grass
  - Make "Join" button blue like the sky
  - Add rainbow colors somewhere!

- Less words, more pictures!
  - Show dominoes falling down when no games
  - Show happy faces for how many friends are playing
  - Use smiley faces instead of "status"

- Make it simple!
  - Just two big buttons: "Start Playing!" and "Find Friends!"
  - No dropdowns - they're confusing
  - Show games with pictures of how many friends are there (like ðŸ‘¦ðŸ‘§ for 2 players)

## My Simple Ideas

- Change "No games available" to "No one is playing yet! ðŸ˜¢"
- Change "Create a new game to get started!" to "Let's play dominoes! ðŸŽ¯"
- Make the empty picture be actual dominoes, not that weird box thing
- Add sounds! Like "ding!" when you press buttons
- Show me how to play with a cartoon or pictures, not words
- Make everything BIGGER so I can see it better
- Add a mascot! Like a friendly domino character that helps me

## What I Really Want

I just want to press ONE BIG BUTTON that says "PLAY!" and then the game starts. All this other stuff is too complicated. Maybe have a happy domino friend that shows me what to do with pictures, not all these words that I can't read yet.

And please make it colorful! Gray is boring. I like rainbows and bright colors that make me happy! ðŸŒˆ
