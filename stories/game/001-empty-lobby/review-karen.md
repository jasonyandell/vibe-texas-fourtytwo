# Karen's Hostile User Review: Story 001 - Empty Lobby

## What The Hell Is Wrong With This App?

### 1. TWO Create Game Buttons? Are You KIDDING Me?

So I open this stupid app and I see TWO "Create Game" buttons. ONE at the top of the page and ANOTHER one in the middle when there are no games. WHICH ONE DO I CLICK? Why are there TWO? This is the dumbest design I've ever seen. Pick ONE place for the button and stick with it!

### 2. That Patronizing "No Games Available" Message

"There are currently no active games in the lobby." NO SHIT, SHERLOCK! I can SEE it's empty! And then you follow it up with "Create a new game to get started!" like I'm some kind of idiot who can't figure out what to do next. Stop talking down to me!

### 3. Why Do I Need to Name My Game?

I just want to play dominoes! Why am I forced to come up with a creative name? And then you have the AUDACITY to tell me it needs to be between 3 and 50 characters? Just auto-generate "Game #1" or something and let me PLAY!

### 4. That Stupid Modal

A modal? Really? In 2025? Why can't the game creation just be inline on the page? Now I have to:
1. Click a button
2. Wait for a modal to animate in
3. Type a name
4. Click ANOTHER button
5. Wait for it to close

That's FIVE steps just to create a game! This should be ONE click!

### 5. "Join Random Game" Button That Does NOTHING

There's a "Join Random Game" button that's DISABLED when there are no games. Why is it even THERE if I can't use it? Either hide it or make it do something useful like create a game for me!

### 6. Useless Filter and Sort Controls

Filter by status? Sort by newest? THERE ARE NO GAMES! Why are these controls even visible when the lobby is empty? You're wasting my screen space with controls I can't use!

### 7. That Pretentious "Welcome to Texas 42!"

I KNOW what website I'm on! I clicked the link to get here! Stop wasting space with obvious welcome messages and let me GET TO THE GAME!

### 8. "0 players online" - Thanks for Reminding Me I'm Alone

Great, not only is the lobby empty, but you're rubbing it in my face that literally NO ONE else is playing. How about hiding this depressing stat when it's zero?

### 9. No Quick Start Option

Where's the "Play Now" button that just:
- Creates a game automatically
- Adds some AI players
- Starts the damn game

Why do I have to manage a lobby like I'm running a tournament?

### 10. Character Counter While Typing? REALLY?

"15/50 characters" - WHO CARES? I'm naming a casual domino game, not writing a tweet! And that red text telling me "minimum 3 characters" - just let me type "42" and be done with it!

## What Would Make Me Rage Quit

1. Having to create an account just to play
2. Any more modals or popups
3. Having to wait for other players with no AI option
4. More steps between me and actually playing dominoes

## Bottom Line

This app thinks it's SO clever with its multiple buttons, helpful messages, and form validation. Just let me click ONE button and start playing dominoes! Stop making everything so complicated!

I'm going back to playing dominoes with my neighbor Earl. At least he doesn't make me name the game and count characters!
