## Potential Improvements

1. **Game code copying**

2. **Loading feedback**
   - Consider adding a spinner or progress indicator
   - Current "Loading..." text in button is good but minimal

3. **Success feedback**

4. **Empty state**
   - When no games exist, create button is prominent
   - Good discoverability

## Accessibility
