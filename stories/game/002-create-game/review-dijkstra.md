# Dijkstra Review - Story 002: Create Game

## Correctness Review

### API Endpoint (backend/src/api/game.ts)
✅ **Correct validation logic**
- Game name is trimmed and validated for length (3-50 chars)
- Duplicate name checking works correctly
- HTTP status codes are appropriate (400 for validation errors)

✅ **Proper error handling**
- Try-catch blocks prevent crashes
- Generic 500 error returned on exceptions

⚠️ **Minor issue**: Status code 409 should be used for duplicate names (currently using 400)

### CreateGameModal Component
✅ **Form validation matches backend**
- Client-side validation mirrors server requirements
- Real-time feedback on character count
- Submit button disabled when invalid

✅ **Proper async handling**
- Loading state prevents double submissions
- Errors displayed appropriately

### GameCard Component
✅ **Displays correct information**
- Shows game name, player count, and status
- Game code displayed with correct format

### Game Code Generation
✅ **Deterministic codes**
- Game codes are based on game ID (deterministic)
- 6 characters using A-Z0-9 as specified

## Clarity Review

### Code Organization
✅ **Well-structured modules**
- GameEngine separated into logical managers
- Clear separation of concerns

### Error Messages
✅ **User-friendly messages**
- "A game with this name already exists" is clear
- Character count feedback is helpful

## Recommendations
1. Change duplicate name error to use HTTP 409 status code
2. Consider adding rate limiting to prevent spam
3. Game codes could use better randomization (currently deterministic)

## Overall Assessment
The implementation is correct and handles all specified requirements. The code is clear and well-organized. Minor improvements suggested above do not affect functionality.
