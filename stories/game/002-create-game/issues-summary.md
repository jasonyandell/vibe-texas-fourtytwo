## Issues to Address

### High Priority
1. **Game code collision risk** (Kid review)
   - Game codes are deterministic based on game ID
   - No uniqueness check on codes
   - Could lead to duplicate codes

### Medium Priority
2. **HTTP status code for duplicates** (Dijkstra review)
   - Currently returns 400 for duplicate names
   - Should return 409 Conflict

3. **Missing data handling** (Kid review)
   - API response assumes data exists
   - Should handle case where success but no data

### Low Priority (Enhancements)
4. **Copy game code feature** (Karen review)
   - Add copy button next to game code
   - Show "Copied!" feedback

5. **Success notification** (Karen review)
   - Add toast notification when game created
   - Currently just closes modal silently

6. **Unicode character handling** (Kid review)
   - Consider normalizing Unicode in game names
   - Emojis and special characters might cause issues

7. **Rate limiting** (Dijkstra review)
   - Add rate limiting to prevent spam
   - Not critical but good practice

## Recommendation
Address high and medium priority issues before marking story as complete. Low priority items can be tracked as enhancement tickets for future iterations.
