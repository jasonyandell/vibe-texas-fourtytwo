# Kid Review - Story 002: Create Game

## Edge Cases and Bug Hunting

### Input Validation
✅ **Empty strings handled**
- Can't submit with empty name
- Can't submit with only spaces (trimmed)

✅ **Length limits enforced**
- maxLength="50" prevents typing beyond limit
- Backend also validates length

🐛 **Potential issue**: Unicode characters
- What if someone uses emojis? "🎮 Game"
- Multi-byte characters might count differently

### Race Conditions
🐛 **Double-click submission**
- isCreating flag prevents this, but...
- What if network is slow and user refreshes?

✅ **Concurrent creation**
- Backend checks for duplicates
- But timing window exists between check and create

### Game Code Generation
🐛 **Collision possibility**
- Codes are deterministic based on game ID
- Same first 6 chars of ID = same code
- No uniqueness check on codes

✅ **Character set is safe**
- Only A-Z0-9, no confusing chars (0/O, 1/I)

### Error Handling
✅ **Network errors caught**
- Generic "Failed to create game" shown

🐛 **Missing error case**
- What if server returns success but no game data?
- Code assumes data exists in response

### State Management
✅ **Modal state reset**
- Form clears when reopened
- Errors cleared on input change

🐛 **Browser back button**
- Modal state not in URL
- Back button won't close modal

### Memory Leaks
✅ **Event listeners cleaned up**
- useModalKeyboardHandling handles cleanup

### Weird Inputs
- Name: "../../etc/passwd" ✅ (treated as string)
- Name: "<script>alert('xss')</script>" ✅ (escaped in display)
- Name: Very long URL ✅ (truncated at 50)
- Name: Only numbers "123456" ✅ (valid)
- Name: Special chars "Game #1!" ✅ (allowed)

## Recommendations
1. Add uniqueness check for game codes
2. Add debounce on submit button
3. Handle missing data in API response
4. Consider normalizing Unicode in game names
5. Add retry logic for network failures

## Overall Assessment
Most edge cases are handled well. The main concerns are around game code collisions and some minor error handling gaps. The implementation is resilient to most "kid-like" attempts to break it.
