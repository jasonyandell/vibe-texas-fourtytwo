# Story: Texas 42 Scoring Calculation Research

## Overview
Research and document the complete scoring system for Texas 42, including trick points, domino points, bid fulfillment, and game-ending conditions.

## User Story
**As a** developer implementing Texas 42 scoring  
**I want** to understand all scoring rules and calculations  
**So that** I can implement accurate score tracking and game completion logic

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Document how trick points are calculated
- [x] Specify bid fulfillment and failure consequences
- [x] Define partnership scoring mechanics
- [x] Document game-ending conditions and winning criteria
- [x] Identify any bonus scoring or special cases

## Research Tasks
- [x] Research how many points each trick is worth (typically 1)
- [x] Document bid fulfillment rules (must make bid to score)
- [x] Research what happens when bid is not made
- [x] Determine how partnership points are combined
- [x] Research game-ending score (typically 250 or 500)
- [x] Identify any bonus scoring situations
- [x] Research scoring for special bids (84, 168, etc.)

## Research Findings

### Basic Scoring System (Marks Version)

**Game Objective:** First team to reach **7 marks** wins

**Mark Scoring Rules:**
- **Bid 30-41:** Win = 1 mark, Lose = opponents get 1 mark
- **Bid 42 (1 mark):** Win = 1 mark, Lose = opponents get 1 mark
- **Bid 2+ marks:** Win = bid amount, Lose = opponents get bid amount

**Bid Fulfillment:**
- **Must win at least bid amount** in points (30-41)
- **Must win ALL tricks** for 42+ bids (unless special contract)
- **Failure = "Set"** - opponents score the marks instead

### Point Calculation Within Hand

**Total Points Available:** 42 points per hand
- **Trick points:** 7 tricks × 1 point = 7 points
- **Domino points:** 35 points from scoring dominoes
  - 6-4 = 10 points
  - 5-5 = 10 points
  - 5-0 = 5 points
  - 4-1 = 5 points
  - 3-2 = 5 points

**Partnership Scoring:**
- **Partners combine their tricks** for total points
- **Only the bidding team** needs to make their bid
- **Opponents automatically score** if bidders fail

### Special Contract Scoring

**Nello (1+ marks):**
- **Success:** Lose all tricks = score bid amount
- **Failure:** Win any trick = opponents score bid amount

**Plunge (4+ marks):**
- **Success:** Win all 7 tricks = score bid amount
- **Failure:** Lose any trick = opponents score bid amount

**Sevens (1+ marks):**
- **Success:** Win all 7 tricks = score bid amount
- **Failure:** Lose any trick = opponents score bid amount

### Game Ending and Winning

**Victory Condition:** First team to **7 marks**

**Mark Tracking:** Traditional "ALL" system
- Mark 1: Left side of "A"
- Mark 2: Right side of "A"
- Mark 3: Crossbar of "A"
- Mark 4: Vertical of first "L"
- Mark 5: Horizontal of first "L"
- Mark 6: Vertical of second "L"
- Mark 7: Horizontal of second "L" = "ALL" complete

**Excess Marks:** Ignored (game ends at 7, not beyond)

### Alternative Scoring System (Points Version)

**Game Objective:** First team to reach **250 or 500 points**

**Point Scoring Rules:**
- **Bid 30-41:** Both teams score points they won (if bid made)
- **Bid failed:** Bidders score 0, opponents score their points + bid amount
- **Bid 42:** Bidders score 42 if successful, 0 if failed
- **Bid 84:** Double scoring (84 points if successful)
- **Bid 168:** Quadruple scoring (168 points if successful)

**Special Bids in Points Version:**
- **84 bid:** Can only be made after someone bids 42
- **168 bid:** Can only be made after someone bids 84
- **Low-No:** Equivalent to Nello, worth 42 points

## Implementation Specifications

### Score Tracking Data Structures
```javascript
class GameScore {
  constructor() {
    this.northSouth = 0;  // Marks for North-South partnership
    this.eastWest = 0;    // Marks for East-West partnership
    this.gameType = 'marks'; // 'marks' or 'points'
    this.targetScore = 7;    // 7 for marks, 250/500 for points
  }

  addMarks(partnership, marks) {
    this[partnership] += marks;
  }

  isGameComplete() {
    return this.northSouth >= this.targetScore || this.eastWest >= this.targetScore;
  }

  getWinner() {
    if (this.northSouth >= this.targetScore) return 'northSouth';
    if (this.eastWest >= this.targetScore) return 'eastWest';
    return null;
  }
}
```

### Hand Scoring Algorithm
```javascript
function calculateHandScore(tricks, bid, biddingTeam, trumpSuit) {
  const biddingTeamPoints = calculateTeamPoints(tricks, biddingTeam);
  const bidAmount = bid.amount;
  const bidType = bid.type; // 'points', 'marks', 'special'

  let result = {
    biddingTeamMarks: 0,
    opposingTeamMarks: 0,
    bidMade: false
  };

  // Check if bid was made
  if (bidType === 'special') {
    result.bidMade = checkSpecialContract(tricks, bid, biddingTeam);
  } else if (bidAmount >= 42) {
    result.bidMade = (biddingTeamPoints === 42); // Must win all tricks
  } else {
    result.bidMade = (biddingTeamPoints >= bidAmount); // Must make bid
  }

  // Award marks based on success/failure
  if (result.bidMade) {
    result.biddingTeamMarks = Math.max(1, Math.floor(bidAmount / 42));
  } else {
    result.opposingTeamMarks = Math.max(1, Math.floor(bidAmount / 42));
  }

  return result;
}

function calculateTeamPoints(tricks, team) {
  let totalPoints = 0;

  tricks.forEach(trick => {
    if (trick.winner.partnership === team) {
      // Add 1 point for winning the trick
      totalPoints += 1;

      // Add domino points from the trick
      trick.dominoes.forEach(domino => {
        totalPoints += getDominoPoints(domino);
      });
    }
  });

  return totalPoints;
}
```

### Bid Fulfillment Logic
```javascript
function checkBidFulfillment(bid, teamPoints, tricksWon) {
  switch (bid.type) {
    case 'points':
      return teamPoints >= bid.amount;

    case 'marks':
      if (bid.amount >= 42) {
        return tricksWon === 7; // Must win all tricks
      }
      return teamPoints >= bid.amount;

    case 'nello':
      return tricksWon === 0; // Must lose all tricks

    case 'plunge':
    case 'sevens':
      return tricksWon === 7; // Must win all tricks

    default:
      throw new Error(`Unknown bid type: ${bid.type}`);
  }
}
```

### Special Contract Validation
```javascript
function checkSpecialContract(tricks, bid, biddingTeam) {
  const teamTricks = tricks.filter(trick => trick.winner.partnership === biddingTeam);

  switch (bid.contract) {
    case 'nello':
      return teamTricks.length === 0; // Must lose all tricks

    case 'plunge':
    case 'sevens':
      return teamTricks.length === 7; // Must win all tricks

    default:
      return false;
  }
}
```

### Game Completion Detection
```javascript
function checkGameEnd(gameScore) {
  const maxScore = Math.max(gameScore.northSouth, gameScore.eastWest);

  if (gameScore.gameType === 'marks') {
    return maxScore >= 7;
  } else {
    return maxScore >= gameScore.targetScore; // 250 or 500 for points
  }
}

function getGameWinner(gameScore) {
  if (!checkGameEnd(gameScore)) return null;

  return gameScore.northSouth >= gameScore.targetScore ? 'northSouth' : 'eastWest';
}
```

### Score Display Requirements
- **Current marks/points:** Clear display for both partnerships
- **Hand results:** Show points won and bid fulfillment
- **Mark progression:** Visual "ALL" display for marks version
- **Game completion:** Clear winner announcement
- **Score history:** Access to previous hand results

### Validation Rules
- Total points per hand must equal 42
- Marks can only be whole numbers
- Game ends immediately when target reached
- No negative scores allowed
- Partnership scores are combined

## Definition of Done
- [x] All scoring rules documented and verified
- [x] Bid fulfillment logic clearly defined
- [x] Partnership scoring mechanics specified
- [x] Game-ending conditions documented
- [x] Rules validated against 2+ authoritative sources (pagat.com)

2. **Scoring Summary** - docs/rules/scoring-summary.md

## Story Status: COMPLETE ✅
All acceptance criteria met. Scoring system is implementation-ready with complete calculation algorithms and game completion logic.

## Estimated Effort
4-5 hours

## Dependencies
- Domino Point Values research (for domino scoring)
- Bidding Mechanics research (for bid fulfillment)

## Notes
Scoring ties together all other game mechanics. Understanding exactly how points are calculated, when they're awarded, and how the game ends is crucial for a complete implementation.
