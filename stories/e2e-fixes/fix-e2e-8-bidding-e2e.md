# Story: Create Comprehensive Bidding E2E Tests

## Overview
Create comprehensive end-to-end tests for the bidding system that cover the complete flow from lobby to bidding phase. This ensures the bidding functionality works correctly in the full application context.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Complete Bidding Flow
- [ ] Test full flow: lobby → game creation → player joining → game start → bidding
- [ ] Verify bidding interface appears when game reaches bidding phase
- [ ] Test all bidding actions (bid, pass, trump selection)
- [ ] Verify bidding turn progression and completion

### Bidding Interface Testing
- [ ] Test bid input validation (30-42 range, increments)
- [ ] Test trump suit selection for all suits
- [ ] Test pass functionality and turn advancement
- [ ] Test bidding completion and transition to playing phase

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test bidding with multiple players
- [ ] Verify game state updates during bidding
- [ ] Test bidding with different game scenarios
- [ ] Ensure bidding works with spectator mode

### E2E Test Coverage
Create comprehensive tests for:
- Complete game flow including bidding
- Bidding validation and error handling
- Multi-player bidding scenarios
- Bidding accessibility features

## Technical Requirements

### Test Implementation
1. **Complete Flow Tests** (`tests/e2e/bidding-flow.spec.ts`)
   - Test lobby to bidding phase flow
   - Simulate multiple players joining
   - Test game start and bidding phase transition
   - Verify complete bidding round

2. **Bidding Interaction Tests** (`tests/e2e/bidding-interactions.spec.ts`)
   - Test all bidding controls and inputs
   - Verify bid validation and feedback
   - Test trump suit selection
   - Test pass functionality

3. **Multi-Player Bidding Tests** (`tests/e2e/bidding-multiplayer.spec.ts`)
   - Simulate multiple browser contexts
   - Test bidding turn progression
   - Verify game state synchronization
   - Test bidding completion scenarios

### Test Utilities
- Create helper functions for common bidding scenarios
- Add utilities for simulating multiple players
- Implement game state verification helpers
- Add accessibility testing for bidding interface

### Mock Data and Scenarios
- Create realistic bidding scenarios
- Add edge case testing (minimum/maximum bids)
- Test various trump suit combinations
- Include error condition testing

## Implementation Notes
- Build comprehensive test coverage for bidding system
- Ensure tests are reliable and maintainable
- Use proper test data and scenarios
- Include both happy path and edge case testing

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Comprehensive bidding E2E tests are implemented
- [ ] All bidding scenarios are covered
- [ ] Tests are reliable and pass consistently
- [ ] Integration with lobby and game flow works
- [ ] Accessibility testing is included
- [ ] Test documentation is complete

## Testing Strategy
1. Implement complete flow tests
2. Add detailed bidding interaction tests
3. Create multi-player simulation tests
4. Test error conditions and edge cases
5. Verify accessibility compliance
6. Ensure test reliability and maintainability

## Dependencies
- Builds on all previous stories
- Requires working lobby and game creation
- Uses existing bidding implementation
- May need test utilities and helpers
