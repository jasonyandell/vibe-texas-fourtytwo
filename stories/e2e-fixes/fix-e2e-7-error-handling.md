# Story: Fix Error Handling E2E Tests

## Overview
Implement proper error handling, loading states, and network error management to make error handling E2E tests pass. This includes graceful degradation and user feedback for various error conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Loading States
- [ ] Loading indicators appear during game creation
- [ ] Buttons are disabled during loading operations
- [ ] Loading spinners show for lobby data fetching
- [ ] Form submission shows loading state

### Error Display
- [ ] Network errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] Error states don't break the application
- [ ] Users can recover from error conditions

### Network Error Handling
- [ ] Lobby loads even if some network requests fail
- [ ] Offline/connection error states are handled
- [ ] Retry mechanisms are available
- [ ] Fallback content shows when appropriate

### E2E Test Targets
Make these specific tests pass:
- `should handle network errors gracefully`
- `should show loading states`
- Tests that verify error recovery

## Technical Requirements

### Component Updates
1. **Lobby Component** (`src/components/Lobby.tsx`)
   - Add proper error boundary handling
   - Show loading states during operations
   - Handle network error scenarios
   - Provide error recovery options

2. **CreateGameModal Component** (`src/components/lobby/CreateGameModal.tsx`)
   - Add loading state during game creation
   - Disable submit button during loading
   - Show error messages for failed creation
   - Handle form validation errors

3. **LobbyList Component** (`src/components/lobby/LobbyList.tsx`)
   - Improve error state display
   - Add retry functionality
   - Show loading spinners appropriately
   - Handle empty states gracefully

### Error Management
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add error logging and reporting
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Handle different types of errors appropriately

### Loading State Management
- Add loading indicators to all async operations
- Disable interactive elements during loading
- Show progress feedback to users
- Handle loading state cleanup

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on user experience during error conditions
- Ensure application remains functional during errors
- Provide clear feedback and recovery options
- Use existing loading and error components

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Loading states display correctly
- [ ] Error conditions are handled gracefully
- [ ] Network errors don't break the application
- [ ] All error handling E2E tests pass
- [ ] Users can recover from error states
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality

## Testing Strategy
1. Test loading states during operations
2. Simulate network errors and verify handling
3. Test error recovery mechanisms
4. Verify button states during loading
5. Test error message display
6. Run full test suite for regressions

## Dependencies
- Builds on all previous stories
- Uses existing error and loading components
- Requires proper state management
- May need error boundary implementation
