# Story: Shared Types Package for Frontend/Backend Consistency

## Overview
Create a shared types package to eliminate frontend/backend type drift and ensure consistent Texas 42 rule implementation across all components. This foundational story establishes the architecture for authentic rule compliance.

**ðŸ”„ Rules Integration**: This story implements the technical architecture recommendations from the reconciliation plan to support complete Texas 42 rule implementation.

## User Story
**As a developer**, I want a shared types package between frontend and backend so that I can ensure consistent Texas 42 rule implementation and eliminate type drift issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

### âœ… Monorepo Structure Setup
- [ ] Create `packages/` directory structure
- [ ] Setup `packages/shared-types/` package with proper configuration
- [ ] Configure TypeScript compilation for shared package
- [ ] Setup package exports and imports
- [ ] Configure build pipeline for shared types
- [ ] Update frontend and backend to use shared types

### âœ… Enhanced Domino Types
- [ ] **NEW**: Implement complete Domino interface with point values
```typescript
interface Domino {
  high: number;        // 0-6
  low: number;         // 0-6
  id: string;          // unique identifier
  pointValue: number;  // 0, 5, or 10 points
  isCountDomino: boolean; // true for scoring dominoes
}
```
- [ ] **NEW**: Create domino factory functions with validation
- [ ] **NEW**: Implement point value calculation utilities

```typescript
type DominoSuit = 'blanks' | 'ones' | 'twos' | 'threes' | 'fours' | 'fives' | 'sixes' | 'doubles';
```
- [ ] **NEW**: Trump system configuration interface
- [ ] **NEW**: Domino-to-suit mapping types
- [ ] **NEW**: Trump hierarchy and comparison types
- [ ] **NEW**: No-trump options (doubles high/low)

### âœ… Enhanced Bidding System Types
- [ ] **NEW**: Complete Bid interface with special contracts
```typescript
interface Bid {
  playerId: string;
  amount: number;           // 30-41 for point bids
  marks?: number;           // 1+ for mark bids
  trump?: DominoSuit;       // chosen trump suit
  isSpecialContract: boolean;
  contractType?: SpecialContractType;
  doublesOption?: 'high' | 'low';
  timestamp: string;
}
```

## Rules Integration Details

### From Gap Analysis
- **Type Duplication**: Eliminates duplicate type definitions between frontend/backend
- **Inconsistent Implementation**: Provides single source of truth for all game types
- **Missing Rule Support**: Adds types for all researched Texas 42 rules

### From Technical Architecture Review
- **Shared Package Strategy**: Implements recommended monorepo structure
- **Model Unification**: Ensures consistent types across all components
- **Performance Considerations**: Optimized type definitions for game logic

## Technical Implementation

### Package Structure
```
packages/shared-types/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dominoes.ts      # Domino types and utilities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ trump.ts         # Trump suit system types
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bidding.ts       # Bidding and special contracts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scoring.ts       # Scoring and marks system

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ validation.ts    # Validation types and interfaces
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts         # Package exports
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### Core Type Definitions

#### Dominoes (`src/dominoes.ts`)
```typescript
export interface Domino {
  high: number;
  low: number;
  id: string;
  pointValue: number;
  isCountDomino: boolean;
}

export interface DominoSet {
  dominoes: Domino[];
  totalPoints: number; // Must equal 35
  isValid: boolean;
}

export function createDomino(high: number, low: number): Domino;
export function createFullDominoSet(): DominoSet;
export function calculateDominoPointValue(high: number, low: number): number;
export function isCountDomino(domino: Domino): boolean;
```

#### Trump System (`src/trump.ts`)
```typescript
export type DominoSuit = 'blanks' | 'ones' | 'twos' | 'threes' | 'fours' | 'fives' | 'sixes' | 'doubles';

export interface TrumpSystem {
  suit: DominoSuit;
  isNoTrump: boolean;
  doublesOption?: 'high' | 'low';
}

export interface DominoSuitMapping {
  domino: Domino;
  suits: DominoSuit[];
  isTrump: boolean;
  trumpRank?: number;
}
```

### Package Configuration

#### `package.json`
```json
{
  "name": "@texas42/shared-types",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "dev": "tsc --watch"
  },

    "target": "ES2020",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "declaration": true,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["dist", "node_modules"]
}
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Package Setup (1-2 hours)
1. Create package structure and configuration
2. Implement basic type definitions
3. Setup build pipeline

### Phase 2: Type Migration (2-3 hours)
1. Move existing types to shared package
2. Enhance types with rule compliance features
3. Update imports in frontend and backend

### Phase 3: Validation (1 hour)
1. Ensure all imports work correctly
2. Run existing tests to verify no regressions
3. Add new tests for enhanced types
