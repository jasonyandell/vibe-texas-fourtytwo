# Story: Game State Management and URL Serialization

## Overview
Implement the core game state management system with URL serialization capabilities, following the design mandate that complete game state must be URL-compatible and serializable. This provides the foundation for all game logic and state persistence.

## User Story
**As a player**, I want the game to maintain its state reliably and allow me to share or bookmark game states so that I can resume games and share interesting positions with others.

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ Game State Types and Interfaces
- [ ] Define complete `GameState` TypeScript interface
- [ ] Create `LobbyState` interface separate from game state
- [ ] Implement `PlayerState` and `PartnershipState` types
- [ ] Define `DominoState` and `TrickState` interfaces
- [ ] Create `BiddingState` and `ScoringState` types
- [ ] Add comprehensive type validation and guards

### ✅ URL Serialization System
- [ ] Implement game state to URL parameter conversion
- [ ] Create URL parameter to game state parsing
- [ ] Handle URL length limitations and compression
- [ ] Support partial state serialization for sharing
- [ ] Add error handling for malformed URLs
- [ ] Implement state versioning for backward compatibility

### ✅ State Management Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up React Context for game state
- [ ] Implement state reducers for game actions
- [ ] Create custom hooks for state access (`useGameState`, `useLobbyState`)
- [ ] Add state validation and error boundaries
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates for UI responsiveness
- [ ] Create state persistence utilities

### ✅ Game State Validation
- [ ] Frontend move validation before backend submission
- [ ] State consistency checks and error recovery
- [ ] Invalid state detection and handling
- [ ] State migration utilities for version changes
- [ ] Comprehensive validation test suite

### ✅ Lobby State Management
- [ ] Player joining and leaving functionality
- [ ] Ready state management for all players
- [ ] Game creation and deletion
- [ ] Spectator mode state handling
- [ ] Lobby list management and updates

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Compliance
- Strict separation of game state and lobby state
- Frontend validation with backend authority
- Complete state serializability to URL parameters
- Type-safe state management throughout
- Error boundaries and graceful degradation

### Performance Requirements
- State updates under 16ms for 60fps UI
- URL serialization under 50ms
- Memory-efficient state storage
- Minimal re-renders on state changes
- Efficient state diffing and updates

### Data Integrity
- Immutable state updates
- State validation at boundaries
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Consistent state across components
- Audit trail for state changes

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete game state can be serialized to URL
- [ ] URL state can be parsed back to valid game state
- [ ] All state interfaces are properly typed
- [ ] State validation prevents invalid states
- [ ] Context providers work across all components
- [ ] Custom hooks provide clean state access
- [ ] Error boundaries handle state errors gracefully
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests for all state operations
- [ ] Integration tests for URL serialization

## Dependencies
- Core domino components (Story 1)
- TypeScript interfaces defined
- React Context setup
- Testing framework configuration

## Estimated Effort
**6-8 hours** - Complex state management with serialization

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all state reducers and actions
- Property-based testing for URL serialization
- Integration tests for state flow
- Error condition testing
- Performance testing for large state objects
- Cross-browser URL compatibility testing

## Notes
- State must be completely serializable from day one
- Frontend validation is for UX, backend is authoritative
- Consider URL length limits (2048 characters typical)
- Plan for future WebSocket integration
- Ensure state can handle all Texas 42 game scenarios
- Performance is critical for smooth gameplay
