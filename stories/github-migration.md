## Technical Requirements

### Repository Configuration
**MANUAL TASK:** COMPLETED. Create GitHub repository with these specifications:

**Repository Name:** `vibe-texas-fourtytwo`

**Repository Description:**
```
üé≤ Authentic Texas 42 domino game for the web. Built with React, TypeScript, Fastify, and PostgreSQL. Features real-time multiplayer, traditional bidding, and responsive design.
```

**Repository Settings:**
- **Visibility:** `public`
  - **DECISION POINT:** Choose public (open source) or private (team only)
- **Features:** Enable Issues, Projects, Wiki
- **Topics:** `texas-42`, `domino-game`, `typescript`, `react`, `fastify`, `postgresql`, `websockets`, `multiplayer`, `game-development`, `tdd`

### Migration Commands
**MANUAL TASK:** Execute these commands in sequence:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project root
cd c:\code\augment\fourtytwo

# 2. Verify current git status
git status
git log --oneline -5

# 3. Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/jasonyandell/vibe-texas-fourtytwo.git

# 4. Verify remote configuration
git remote -v

# 5. Push main branch with history
git push -u origin main

# 6. Push any additional branches
git branch -a
# If other branches exist, push them:
# git push origin [branch-name]
```

### Branch Protection Configuration
**MANUAL TASK:** Configure branch protection in GitHub Settings ‚Üí Branches:

**Protection Rules for `main` branch:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
- [ ] ‚úÖ Require approvals: 1 minimum
- [ ] ‚úÖ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
- [ ] ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
- [ ] ‚úÖ Include administrators in restrictions
- [ ] ‚è∏Ô∏è Require status checks (defer to CI/CD story)

### GitHub Projects Setup
**AUTOMATED OPTION:** Use the provided automation scripts:

```bash
# Option A: Automated setup (recommended)
# Install GitHub CLI first: https://cli.github.com/
gh auth login
npm run setup:github-projects

# Option B: Manual script execution
# Windows PowerShell:
.\scripts\setup-github-projects.ps1

# macOS/Linux:
chmod +x scripts/setup-github-projects.sh
./scripts/setup-github-projects.sh

# Option C: Node.js script:
node scripts/setup-github-projects.js
```

**MANUAL TASK (if not using automation):** Create project boards with these specifications:

**Projects to Create:**
1. **"Texas 42 Development Board"** - Main development tracking
   - Columns: üìã Backlog, üöß In Progress, üëÄ Review, ‚úÖ Done
2. **"E2E Test Fixes"** - E2E test improvements
   - Columns: üìã To Fix, üîß Fixing, ‚úÖ Fixed
3. **"Texas 42 Rules Research"** - Rules research and validation
   - Columns: üìö Research, üìù Documenting, ‚úÖ Complete

**Automation Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Creates 3 organized project boards automatically
- ‚úÖ Converts all `stories/*.md` files to GitHub Issues
- ‚úÖ Applies appropriate labels (story, bug, rules, e2e-tests)
- ‚úÖ Links issues back to original story files
- ‚úÖ Saves 2-3 hours of manual setup time

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Repository Creation
**MANUAL TASK:** 
1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in
2. Click "New repository" or go to https://github.com/new
3. Fill in repository details using specifications above
4. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Local Repository Migration ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **CURRENT STEP**
Execute migration commands listed in Technical Requirements section.

### Step 3: Documentation Updates
**MANUAL TASK:** Update documentation files:

1. **Update README.md clone URL:**
   - Find line: `git clone <repository-url>`
   - Replace with: `git clone https://github.com/jasonyandell/vibe-texas-fourtytwo.git`
   - Update directory name: `cd vibe-texas-fourtytwo`

2. **Add GitHub badges to README.md** (insert after title):
   ```markdown
   [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
   [![Node.js Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-%3E%3D18.0.0-brightgreen)](https://nodejs.org/)

   - **ACTION REQUIRED:** Add team member GitHub usernames:
     - `[PLACEHOLDER: TEAM_MEMBER_1_USERNAME]`
     - `[PLACEHOLDER: TEAM_MEMBER_2_USERNAME]`
     - `[PLACEHOLDER: TEAM_MEMBER_3_USERNAME]`
