# Demo Plan Phase 7: Polish & Accessibility

## Prerequisites
**CRITICAL**: Read and understand all documentation in @docs/ before starting:
- `@docs/design.md` - TDD methodology and accessibility requirements
- `@docs/DEVELOPER.md` - Development standards and best practices
- `@stories/demo-plan-0.md` - Overview of demo showcase requirements
- Review WCAG 2.1 guidelines for interactive content

**Dependency**: Phase 6 (Game Flow) must be complete with all tests passing.

## Goal
Add comprehensive accessibility features, keyboard navigation, and visual polish to create an inclusive and beautiful demo experience.

## What to Build
- Object detail modals with comprehensive information
- Full keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- ARIA labels and screen reader support throughout
