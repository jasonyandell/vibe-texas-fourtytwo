## Technical Implementation Requirements

### Demo Infrastructure
```typescript
interface DemoState {
  currentSlide: number;
  gameState: GameState | null;
  demoMode: 'showcase' | 'simulation' | 'interactive';
  playbackSpeed: 'slow' | 'normal' | 'fast';
  autoAdvance: boolean;
}

interface DemoControls {
  play: () => void;
  pause: () => void;
  reset: () => void;
  nextSlide: () => void;
  previousSlide: () => void;
  setSpeed: (speed: DemoState['playbackSpeed']) => void;
  toggleAutoAdvance: () => void;
}
```

### Mock Data Requirements
```typescript
// Pre-defined game states for each demo scene
const demoGameStates = {
  lobbyEmpty: LobbyState;
  gameCreated: GameState;
  playersJoining: GameState[];
  biddingPhase: GameState[];
  firstTrick: GameState[];
  secondTrick: GameState[];
};

// Pre-defined player actions
const demoActions = {
  bids: Bid[];
  plays: DominoPlay[];
  stateTransitions: StateTransition[];
};
```

### Playwright E2E Test Scenario
```typescript
test('Complete Texas 42 Game Flow', async ({ page }) => {
  // Record video for the entire test
  await page.video()?.path();
  
  // Scene 1: Lobby
  await page.goto('/demo');
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="lobby"]')).toBeVisible();
  await page.click('[data-testid="create-game"]');
  
  // Scene 2: Players Joining
  await simulatePlayerJoining(page, 'Player 2', 'east');
  await simulatePlayerJoining(page, 'Player 3', 'south');
  await simulatePlayerJoining(page, 'Player 4', 'west');
  
  // Scene 3: Game Start
  await page.click('[data-testid="start-game"]');
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="game-board"]')).toBeVisible();
  
  // Scene 4: Bidding
  await simulateBiddingRound(page);
  
  // Scene 5: First Trick
  await simulateTrickPlay(page, 1);
  
  // Scene 6: Second Trick Start
  await simulateTrickStart(page, 2);
  
  // Verify final state
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="trick-counter"]')).toContainText('Trick 2 of 7');
});
```
