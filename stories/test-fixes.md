# Test Fixes Task List

Fix the tests.

[✅] Run each test suite individually from the project root to find and fix errors and warnings.  Errors and warnings are both blockers and this can not be considered complete until there are 0 errors and 0 warnings.  Close enough is not close enough.  0 errors, 0 warnings, or do not mark this complete.  Do not change method signatures for async/await issues for synchronous methods.  Add an await Promise.resolve() instead to keep the signature stable
[✅] Comprehensive test run errors and warnings (dig deep).  All warnings are blockers.
