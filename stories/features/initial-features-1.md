# Story: Core Domino Components and Visual Foundation

## Overview
Create the fundamental domino visual components and basic game layout structure that will serve as the foundation for all other game features. This story focuses on authentic Texas 42 domino representation and the core visual building blocks.

## User Story
**As a player**, I want to see authentic-looking double-6 dominoes with proper visual representation so that the game feels familiar and true to traditional Texas 42.

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ Domino Visual Components
- [ ] Create `Domino` component with authentic double-6 visual design
- [ ] Implement all 28 domino combinations (0-0 through 6-6)
- [ ] Support face-up and face-down states
- [ ] Add hover and selection states for interactive dominoes
- [ ] Implement proper domino proportions and styling
- [ ] Create domino pip layouts that match traditional dominoes
- [ ] Support different domino orientations (horizontal/vertical)

### ✅ Basic Layout Structure
- [ ] Create main game container with responsive design
- [ ] Implement baseball diamond positioning system
- [ ] Create player position containers (North, East, South, West)
- [ ] Add center area for current trick display
- [ ] Implement basic responsive breakpoints
- [ ] Create CSS grid/flexbox foundation for game layout

### ✅ Component Library Foundation
- [ ] Set up component directory structure
- [ ] Create shared styling system (CSS modules or styled-components)
- [ ] Implement basic color scheme and typography
- [ ] Create reusable UI primitives (buttons, cards, containers)
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all components
- [ ] Set up component testing infrastructure

### ✅ Domino Hand Layout
- [ ] Create `DominoHand` component for 7-domino display
- [ ] Implement 2-row layout (4 top, 3 bottom centered)
- [ ] Support gaps where dominoes have been played
- [ ] Handle responsive scaling for different screen sizes
- [ ] Add proper spacing and alignment
- [ ] Support both player and opponent hand views

## Technical Requirements

### Component Architecture
- React functional components with TypeScript
- CSS Modules for styling isolation
- Proper prop interfaces and type safety
- Responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, keyboard support)

### Visual Standards
- Authentic domino appearance with proper pip arrangements
- Consistent color scheme matching Texas 42 traditions
- Smooth hover and selection animations
- High contrast mode support
- Scalable design for different screen sizes

### Performance Requirements
- Fast rendering of domino components
- Efficient re-rendering when domino states change
- Minimal bundle size impact
- 60fps animations for hover/selection states

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All 28 domino combinations render correctly
- [ ] Domino components support all required states
- [ ] Baseball diamond layout structure is responsive
- [ ] Component tests cover all visual states
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Visual regression tests pass
- [ ] Components integrate with TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Documentation for component usage

## Dependencies
- Initial project scaffold must be complete
- React and TypeScript setup
- CSS tooling configuration
- Testing framework setup

## Estimated Effort
**4-6 hours** - Foundation components with visual polish

## Testing Strategy
- Component unit tests for all domino states
- Visual regression tests for domino appearance
- Responsive design tests across breakpoints
- Accessibility testing with automated tools
- Cross-browser compatibility verification

## Notes
- Focus on visual accuracy and authenticity
- Components should be reusable across different game contexts
- Prepare for future animation and interaction features
- Ensure components work well with screen readers
- Consider performance implications of rendering many dominoes
