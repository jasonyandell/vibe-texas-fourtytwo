Implement exactly one development story from the plan checklist below. Follow this specific workflow:

**Implementation Steps:**
0. Read and understand story-tracker.md to understand the implementation workflow so far
1. Read and understand the next unchecked story file from the stories/ directory
2. Use task management tools to break down the story into specific implementation tasks
3. Implement the story following TDD approach (write tests first, then implementation)
4. Run all existing tests to ensure no regressions
5. Update the story-tracker.md file with a detailed summary of what was implemented along with any implementation notes, design decisions, or plan modifications
6. Check the box for the completed story in docs/plan.md

**Story Implementation Checklist:**
[x] implement stories/initial-features-1.md
[x] implement stories/initial-features-2.md
[ ] implement stories/initial-features-3.md
[ ] implement stories/initial-features-4.md
[ ] implement stories/initial-features-5.md
[ ] implement stories/initial-features-6.md
[ ] implement stories/initial-features-7.md
[ ] implement stories/initial-features-8.md
[ ] implement stories/end-to-end-demo.md

**Important Requirements:**
- Implement only ONE story per request - do not proceed to the next story automatically
- Follow the consolidated design.md file as the authoritative source for all design decisions
- Use frontend for move validation, backend for all other game computation
- Create comprehensive tests for each implemented feature
- Ensure all tests pass before marking a story complete
- Ask for permission before installing any new dependencies
