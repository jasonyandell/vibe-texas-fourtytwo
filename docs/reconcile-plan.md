Implement exactly one reconciliation story from the plan checklist below. Follow this specific workflow:

**Implementation Steps:**
0. Read and understand reconciliation-tracker.md to understand the reconciliation workflow so far
1. Read and understand the next unchecked story file from the stories/ directory
2. Use task management tools to break down the story into specific implementation tasks
3. Implement the story following TDD approach (write tests first, then implementation)
4. Run all existing tests to ensure no regressions
5. Update the reconciliation-tracker.md file with a detailed summary of what was implemented along with any implementation notes, design decisions, or plan modifications
6. Check the box for the completed story in docs/reconcile-plan.md

**Reconciliation Story Implementation Checklist:**

**Phase 1: Foundation - Core Rule Implementation (Critical Priority)**
[ ] implement stories/shared-types-package.md
[ ] implement stories/domino-point-system.md
[ ] implement stories/trump-suit-system.md
[ ] implement stories/trick-taking-engine.md
[ ] implement stories/mark-scoring-system.md

**Phase 2: Enhanced Game Logic Integration (Important Priority)**
[ ] implement stories/special-contracts-implementation.md
[ ] implement stories/hand-lifecycle-management.md
[ ] implement stories/game-completion-detection.md
[ ] implement stories/dealer-rotation-system.md

**Phase 3: Reconciled Existing Stories (Important Priority)**
[ ] implement stories/initial-features-1-reconciled.md
[ ] implement stories/initial-features-2-reconciled.md
[ ] implement stories/initial-features-3-reconciled.md
[ ] implement stories/initial-features-4-reconciled.md
[ ] implement stories/initial-features-5-reconciled.md
[ ] implement stories/initial-features-6-reconciled.md
[ ] implement stories/initial-features-7-reconciled.md
[ ] implement stories/initial-features-8-reconciled.md

**Phase 4: Advanced UI and Features (Enhancement Priority)**
[ ] implement stories/special-contract-ui.md
[ ] implement stories/trump-selection-interface.md
[ ] implement stories/enhanced-score-display.md
[ ] implement stories/count-domino-indicators.md

**Phase 5: Edge Cases and Error Handling (Quality Priority)**
[ ] implement stories/invalid-play-handling.md
[ ] implement stories/disconnection-recovery.md
[ ] implement stories/misdeal-procedures.md
[ ] implement stories/timeout-management.md

**Phase 6: Testing and Validation (Quality Priority)**
[ ] implement stories/rule-compliance-testing.md
[ ] implement stories/performance-optimization.md
[ ] implement stories/accessibility-enhancement.md
[ ] implement stories/cross-browser-compatibility.md

**Phase 7: Architecture and Infrastructure (Enhancement Priority)**
[ ] implement stories/game-engine-package.md
[ ] implement stories/monorepo-setup.md

**Important Requirements:**
- Implement only ONE story per request - do not proceed to the next story automatically
- Follow the rules research documentation in docs/rules/ as the authoritative source for all Texas 42 rules
- Ensure 100% authentic Texas 42 rule compliance in all implementations
- Use frontend for move validation, backend for authoritative game logic
- Create comprehensive tests for each implemented feature with rule validation
- Ensure all tests pass before marking a story complete
- Ask for permission before installing any new dependencies
- Prioritize stories in order - complete Phase 1 before moving to Phase 2
- Each story must include rule compliance validation against the research documentation

**Success Criteria for Reconciliation:**
- All Texas 42 rules from research are correctly implemented
- Frontend and backend have consistent type definitions and validation
- Complete game can be played from start to finish with authentic rules
- All special contracts (Nello, Plunge, Sevens, Follow Me) are functional
- Scoring system matches authentic Texas 42 (marks, count dominoes, etc.)
- All edge cases and error conditions are properly handled
- Performance meets requirements (<10ms game action latency)
- 95% test coverage with 100% rule coverage validation
