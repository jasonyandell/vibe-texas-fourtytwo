## Priority Labels

The following priority labels have been created and applied:

- **priority-1-critical** (ðŸ”´): Foundation work that must be completed first
- **priority-2-high** (ðŸŸ ): High priority core systems
- **priority-3-medium** (ðŸŸ¡): Medium priority game logic
- **priority-4-low** (ðŸŸ¢): Lower priority UI and polish
- **priority-5-later** (âš«): Infrastructure and deployment - can be done later

## Dependencies and Execution Order

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. **Shared Types Package (#36)** must be completed before any other development work
2. **Rules Research (#27, #28)** should inform implementation stories
3. **E2E Test Fixes** should be completed in parallel with development
4. **Infrastructure stories** can be deferred until core functionality is complete

## Board Columns

All project boards use the same column structure:
- **ðŸ“‹ Backlog** - Stories ready to be worked on
- **ðŸš§ In Progress** - Currently being developed
- **ðŸ‘€ Review** - Ready for review and testing
- **âœ… Done** - Completed and verified

## Success Metrics

- Clear priority order for all stories
- Dependencies clearly identified
- No blocking issues in critical path
- Parallel work streams identified
- Regular progress tracking enabled

## Notes

- Priority labels provide clear visual indication of importance
- Dependencies are documented to prevent blocking issues
- Parallel work streams allow for efficient resource utilization
- Regular review and adjustment of priorities as needed
