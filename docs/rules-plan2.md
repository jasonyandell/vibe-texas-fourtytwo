# Texas 42 Rules Research - Final Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document provides the final, optimized plan for implementing Texas 42 rules research based on the improved story breakdown. This plan replaces the original `docs/rules-plan.md` with a more structured, phased approach.

## Implementation Workflow

**Follow this specific workflow for each story:**

1. **Preparation**
   - Read and understand the story file completely
   - Review any existing research in `docs/rules/` directory
   - Use task management tools to break down the story into specific implementation tasks

2. **Research Execution**
   - Conduct thorough research using multiple authoritative sources
   - Document findings in detailed, implementation-ready format
   - Create reference tables, validation rules, and test scenarios

3. **Documentation**
   - Update or create comprehensive documentation in `docs/rules/` directory
   - Ensure all findings are developer-ready specifications
   - Include examples, edge cases, and validation criteria

4. **Validation**
   - Cross-reference findings against multiple sources
   - Verify completeness against story acceptance criteria
   - Update story tracker with detailed summary

5. **Completion**
   - Check the box for the completed story in this plan
   - Update research-tracker.md with comprehensive summary
   - Prepare foundation for dependent stories

## Story Implementation Plan

**Focus:** How trump suits work
- [x] All 7 possible trump suits documented
- [x] Domino-to-suit mapping logic
- [x] Trump hierarchy and comparison rules

#### ✅ Story 5: Trick-Taking Mechanics
**File:** `stories/rules-research-5-trick-taking.md`
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Focus:** Core gameplay mechanics
- [x] Follow-suit rules and exceptions
- [x] Valid play determination logic
- [x] Trick-winning algorithms

### Phase 3: Integration and Edge Cases (Sequential execution)

#### ✅ Story 6: Scoring Calculation
**File:** `stories/rules-research-6-scoring-calculation.md`
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Focus:** Complete scoring system
- [x] Trick points and domino points integration
- [x] Bid fulfillment logic and penalties
- [x] Partnership scoring and game ending conditions

#### ✅ Story 7: Edge Cases and Special Situations
**File:** `stories/rules-research-7-edge-cases.md`
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Focus:** Error handling and unusual scenarios
- [x] Invalid plays and recovery mechanisms
- [x] Misdeals and exposed dominoes handling
- [x] Tie-breaking mechanisms

### Phase 4: Final Validation

#### ✅ Story 8: Implementation Validation
**File:** `stories/rules-research-8-implementation-validation.md`
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Focus:** Final validation and specification creation
- [x] Cross-reference multiple authoritative sources
- [x] Resolve conflicts and ambiguities
- [x] Create final developer-ready specifications

## Success Criteria

### Research Quality Standards
- [x] All rules validated against multiple authoritative sources
- [x] Implementation-ready specifications for all game mechanics
- [x] Comprehensive test scenarios for all rules
- [x] Clear edge case handling documented
- [x] Developer team can implement without additional research

### Documentation Standards
- [x] Complete reference documentation in `docs/rules/`
- [x] All findings cross-referenced and validated
- [x] Implementation examples provided
- [x] Test scenarios and validation criteria included

### Project Readiness
- [x] All 8 focused stories completed successfully
- [x] Rules research foundation complete for implementation
- [x] Clear specifications for all game mechanics
- [x] Edge cases and error handling documented

## Dependencies and Execution Notes

### Story Dependencies
- **Stories 1-2**: Can be executed in parallel (foundation)
- **Stories 3-5**: Must be sequential (core systems build on each other)
- **Stories 6-7**: Must be sequential (integration requires core systems)
- **Story 8**: Requires all previous stories complete

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Thorough Research**: Use multiple authoritative sources for validation
2. **Implementation Focus**: All research must produce developer-ready specifications
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: No gaps in rule coverage
4. **Quality Validation**: Cross-reference and verify all findings

## Migration from Previous Plans

This plan supersedes:
- `docs/rules-plan.md` (original simple checklist)
- Large monolithic stories (`texas-42-rules-research.md`)
- Previous breakdown attempts (`rules-1.md`, `rules-2.md`, `rules-3.md`)

The focused story approach provides:
- Clear scope and boundaries for each research effort
- Better estimation and progress tracking
- Implementation-ready deliverables
- Reduced risk and improved quality

## Next Steps

**✅ ALL STORIES NOW COMPLETE!** The Texas 42 rules research phase is finished and ready for implementation. All 8 research stories have been systematically completed with comprehensive findings:

- **Complete equipment specifications** with all 28 dominoes and setup procedures
- **Validated point system** with exact values totaling 42 points
- **Full bidding system** including special contracts (Nello, Plunge, Sevens)
- **Complete trump suit system** with all 7 suits and ranking algorithms
- **Comprehensive trick-taking mechanics** with follow-suit validation
- **Detailed scoring system** for both marks and points versions
- **Robust edge case handling** with error recovery mechanisms
- **Cross-validated implementation specifications** ready for development

The development team can now proceed with implementing the game mechanics using the comprehensive specifications created through this research process.
