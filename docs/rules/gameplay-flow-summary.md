# Texas 42 Gameplay Flow Summary

## Playing Phase
After the bidding phase, the game proceeds to the playing phase, where players play dominoes in 7 tricks. The winning bidder (declarer) leads the first trick. Players must follow suit if possible. If a player cannot follow suit, they may play any domino, including a trump. The highest domino of the led suit, or the highest trump if played, wins the trick.

## Suit System (7 suits total)
- **Blanks:** 0-0, 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4, 0-5, 0-6
- **Ones:** 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-6
- **Twos:** 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6
- **Threes:** 3-3, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6
- **Fours:** 4-4, 4-5, 4-6
- **Fives:** 5-5, 5-6
- **Sixes:** 6-6

## Key Aspects
- **Leading:** The winning bidder leads the first trick. The winner of each trick leads the next
- **Following Suit:** Players must play a domino of the same suit as the led domino if they have one
- **Suit Determination:** Non-trump dominoes belong to both suits (e.g., 6-4 belongs to both sixes and fours)
- **Trump Dominoes:** All dominoes containing the trump number are exclusively trump (not in other suits)
- **Playing Trump:** If a player cannot follow suit, they may play a trump domino or any other domino
- **Trick Winning:** The highest trump wins, or if no trump, the highest domino of the suit led
- **Turn Order:** Play proceeds clockwise
- **Trick Storage:** Tricks kept face up in order won, visible to all players
