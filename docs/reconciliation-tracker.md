# Reconciliation Implementation Tracker

This document tracks the detailed implementation progress of reconciliation stories for the Texas 42 web game project. These stories integrate the completed rules research with the existing implementation to achieve 100% authentic Texas 42 gameplay.

## Reconciliation Overview

**Objective**: Integrate completed Texas 42 rules research (8 research stories + rules documentation) with existing game implementation stories to achieve authentic Texas 42 gameplay.

**Current Implementation Status**: ~30% rules compliant
**Target Implementation Status**: 100% authentic Texas 42 rules
**Total Estimated Effort**: 62-80 hours over 7-11 weeks

## Rules Research Foundation

### âœ… Completed Rules Research (8 Stories)
1. **Equipment and Setup** - Complete domino set, partnerships, dealing procedures
2. **Domino Point Values** - 5 count dominoes (5-0, 4-1, 3-2, 6-4, 5-5) totaling 35 points
3. **Bidding Mechanics** - 30-41 point bids, mark system, special contracts
4. **Trump Suit System** - 7 trump suits with hierarchy and mapping logic
5. **Trick-Taking Mechanics** - Follow-suit rules, trick-winning determination
6. **Scoring Calculation** - Hand scoring, mark awarding, game completion
7. **Edge Cases** - Invalid plays, misdeals, special situations
8. **Implementation Validation** - Cross-referenced against authoritative sources

## Phase 1: Foundation - Core Rule Implementation

### Story 1: Shared Types Package
**Status**: PENDING
**File**: `stories/shared-types-package.md`
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ Critical
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Dependencies**: None

**Objective**: Create shared types package to eliminate frontend/backend type drift and ensure consistent rule implementation across all components.

**Key Requirements**:
- Monorepo structure with shared packages
- Enhanced Domino interface with point values
- Complete trump suit system types
- Bidding system with special contracts
- Scoring and mark system types
- Shared validation logic

**Rule Compliance**: Foundation for all other rule implementations

### Story 2: Domino Point System
**Status**: PENDING
**File**: `stories/domino-point-system.md`
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ Critical
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours
**Dependencies**: Shared Types Package

**Objective**: Implement complete domino point value system with count domino identification and validation.

**Key Requirements**:
- Point value calculation (5-0, 4-1, 3-2 = 5pts; 6-4, 5-5 = 10pts)
- Count domino identification logic
- Total points validation (35 count points + 7 tricks = 42)
- Visual indicators for count dominoes

**Rule Compliance**: Rules-research-2 (Domino Point Values)

---

### Story 3: Trump Suit System
**Status**: PENDING
**File**: `stories/trump-suit-system.md`
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ Critical
**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours
**Dependencies**: Shared Types Package, Domino Point System

**Objective**: Implement complete 7-suit trump system with domino-to-suit mapping and trump hierarchy.

**Key Requirements**:
- 7 trump suits (blanks, ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, sixes, doubles)
- Domino-to-suit mapping logic
- Trump hierarchy within suits
- Trump vs non-trump comparison
- No-trump options (doubles high/low)

**Rule Compliance**: Rules-research-4 (Trump Suit System)

---

### Story 4: Trick-Taking Engine
**Status**: PENDING
**File**: `stories/trick-taking-engine.md`
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ Critical
**Estimated Effort**: 5-6 hours
**Dependencies**: Trump Suit System

**Objective**: Implement complete trick-taking validation and resolution logic.

**Key Requirements**:
- Follow-suit validation
- Valid play determination
- Trick-winning logic
- Lead suit calculation
- Turn order management

**Rule Compliance**: Rules-research-5 (Trick-Taking Mechanics)

---

### Story 5: Mark Scoring System
**Status**: PENDING
**File**: `stories/mark-scoring-system.md`
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ Critical
**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 hours
**Dependencies**: Domino Point System, Trick-Taking Engine

**Objective**: Implement complete mark-based scoring system with game completion detection.

**Key Requirements**:
- Hand scoring calculation (count dominoes + tricks)
- Bid fulfillment checking
- Mark awarding (1 or 2 marks per hand)
- Game completion (7 marks to win)
- Set scoring (when bidding team fails)

**Rule Compliance**: Rules-research-6 (Scoring Calculation)

---

## Implementation Progress Summary

**Phase 1 Status**: 0/5 stories complete
**Overall Progress**: 0/30 total reconciliation stories complete
**Rule Compliance**: Foundation phase - critical for authentic gameplay

**Next Story**: `stories/shared-types-package.md` - Create shared types package for frontend/backend consistency
